# Last Agent #

A Last.fm music tracker (not a scrobbler) for Linux that provides some of the missing functionality of the official client on local music. It allows you to love, tag or share the currently playing track, or add it to a Last.fm playlist, and more... All through a nice, neat and clean interface.

Dependencies are: python, python-gtk2, [pylast](http://pylast.googlecode.com/), python-sexy and python-dbus.
